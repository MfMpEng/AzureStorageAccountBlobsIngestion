	</a>


2. Select the preferred **Subscription**, **Resource Group** and **Location**
   **Note**
   Best practice : Create new Resource Group while deploying - all the resources of your custom Data connector will reside in the newly created Resource
   Suggestion    : ```<<Function App Name>>-rg```

3. Enter the following value in the ARM template deployment
	```
	"Function App Name": Describe the datasource only - ARM template will label resources accordingly.
	"LA Table Name"    : Custom log table that fits the schema of the incoming log source.
	"Workspace Id"     : Azure Log Analytics Workspace Idâ€‹
	"Workspace Key"    : Azure Log Analytics Workspace Key
	```

## Details
1. Write a Log Analytics Workspace table into the target Sentinel that fits the schema of the logs being ingested. Vendor may have json available to quickly convert into ARM format.
2. This package creates an Azure Storage Account called ```<<Function App Name>>-<<uniqueid>>-SA``` and ```<<functionAppName>>>-2Blob``` Container. Send source logs here.
3. Function app is an interminable powershell env orchestrating ingestion based on Event Grid Subscription to SA writes triggering log ingestion procedure on Container Blobs.
